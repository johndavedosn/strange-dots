I do a lot of writing here and there, Not full books but rather just "essays" if you'd call it that (though I do plan on writing a book later :3), Its a pretty nice way to dump all the feelings and thoughts I have into something instead of having to deal with them on my own.

I write in a lot of diverse themes,  Including allegories and philosophical essays,  Though I mostly like writing in a hybrid kind-of theme between the two,  It gives me the ability to both enclose my ideas in metaphors and also explain them clearly for those who don't get allegoria.

I've seen this kind of hybrid-theme writing in one Arabic book series which I really liked- Khawf or "Fear" by Osama Muslim, The narrator/protaginst of the books did this thing where he'd switch from the narrative element of the book to a purely essay-like one,  Allowing them to clearly communicate their perspectives,  Shoutout to Osama Muslim for that series by the way, I read it back in high school and I still think that its the best thing I've read until now!

## The artistic element of writing.

There's a reason I don't consider any essays/books authored by any sort of LLM or AI model to be an artistic piece,  I believe that art is about the way people express themselves,  Their perspectives, Feelings,  Thoughts and goals, But any sort of man-made machine does not have any original thoughts of its own and it strictly cannot produce any,  And so all it will do is express other people's beliefs, Which is completely against what art is.

But also, If you're writing without feeling or connection to what you're making, You're not an artist either,  All you're making is empty texts that express/communicate nothing to the reader, Just like someone reciting a text - They don't have to know what the text ir about or what it is.

More importantly in my humble opinion,  Your work **should** have a goal,  A message of some sort to be transmitted to the reader, The way in which this message should be transmitted does not at all matter,  Whether through clearly communicated essays or hidden behind metaphors and allegoria - Your work must try to convey this message completely even if it fails to.

## What is the hardest part of writing?

The hardest part of writing in my opinion, Is metaphors - It is extremely difficult (for me at least) to take an idea and scramble it into something that only expresses the original thought,  Maybe its because I still lack the mental skills to be able to think outside the box and produce comprehensible metaphors but it is still pretty hard for me to do that.

## Why writing?

A lot of people deeply wonder about why would someone spend their time either typing on a keyboard or wriing on a paper,  What benefit do authors get aside from money that makes them deeply passionate about this hobby to the extent where they might practice it in their free time?

The answer is simple - Self-exploration, When you spend your time just dumping down everything inside of you and get to see yourself with a new,  Outsider perspective, You get to see yourself with completely new eyes,  With the eyes of the people who see and interact with you everyday,  It is an extremely useful and fun thing that allows you to know stuff about yourself you would've never gotten to know normally, All of this is besides your ability to self-improve upon what you've found through writing.



Maybe writing is not for everyone,  And maybe not everyone wants to do it, This is completely fine,  Because the forms of art are endless - And there's always a way one can express themselves.
